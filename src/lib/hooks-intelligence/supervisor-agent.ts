/**
 * Content Intelligence Supervisor — hook context retrieval (stub).
 *
 * CURRENT STATE: This function returns hook examples from the local dataset only.
 * The RL training loop, generate node, and engagement categorization nodes are
 * NOT yet wired. Returning `status: 'hook-context-only'` so callers know exactly
 * what they are getting — previous version returned 'cycle-complete' and
 * `usageTracked: true` even though no generation or training occurred.
 *
 * NEXT WAVE: Wire the generate node (voice pipeline call), pass real performance
 * signals to runTrainingStep(), and connect the engage/optimize nodes.
