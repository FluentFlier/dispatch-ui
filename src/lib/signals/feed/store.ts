/**
 * Unified feed store.

 * The Leads feed presents two very different data sources (real-time signal
 * events and directory leads) as one list. This module owns loading both
 * sources for a workspace, normalizing them into `UnifiedLeadCard`s (Task 5),
 * and merging/sorting/filtering them into the single list the feed endpoint
 * returns. The merge/sort/filter step is kept pure and DB-free so it can be
 * unit-tested without mocking the database.
